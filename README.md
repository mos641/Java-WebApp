# Jakarta EE Web Application
Developed a Java web application using Jakarta Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and JavaServer Faces (JSF) allowing manipulation of game objects called "Sprites" and users stored in a local MySQL database.  
Provided different user groups with varying security permissions, and utilized data validation to ensure the accuracy and integrity of Sprite and user manipulations.  
Created a RESTful API and web interface to enable CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on Sprites and users, maintaining data integrity and providing proper response codes.  
Automated unit tests using JUnit, and web interface testing with Selenium.
